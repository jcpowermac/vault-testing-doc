# Hashicorp Vault testing 
Hashicorp's [documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/) is already very good this repo is mostly for me and my teammates.


I have broken the inital process into multiple markdown documents. [Start here](1_initial_config.md)

#### TOC

[Initial Configuration](1_initial_config.md)
[Create Policy](2_create_policy.md)
[Create Username and Passwords](3_create_userpass.md)
[Write and Read example](4_write_read_example.md)
